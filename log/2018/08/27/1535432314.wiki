This seems like a Google sponsored co-working shared office space in **Seoul**, **South Korea**, geared towards people trying to make tech startups and companies.

"Campus Seoul" https://campus.co/seoul/en

They seem to have an events page too: https://campus.co/seoul/en/events/

I wonder if any of the events are in English.
