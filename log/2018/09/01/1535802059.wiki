Google Maps does not seem to work well in Seoul.

It has been able to find most locations I've tried.

But for whatever reason, it very often cannot calculate a route.

I download Navar Maps to use in Korea.

Some information from **Chris Palasz** (a.k.a. **Carbon Chris**) on why Google Maps doesn't work well in Korea:

― In Korea, Google maps is a no-go.
― You should download and use Naver or Kakao or Daum maps.
― (those are Korean companies. Naver provides English.)
― Korean Government wants to restrict Google maps in ways that Google refuses, so Google doesn’t get permission to use shared info.
― 
― There’s a law that maps of Korea must blur details of sensitive locations such as government buildings and military bases.
― Google agreed to do this for their Korean version, but refuses to do this for their other versions.
― So anyone could just switch to a different version to see.
